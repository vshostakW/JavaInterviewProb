Messages4You Inc. is a company that was founded on making the best instant-messenger platform for internet users. They successfully
created a messaging platform that is faster and delivers higher quality than their competitors. They've continued to grow their user base,
and now they need your help to resolve some user complaints they've received.  Messages4You is used widely across North America, but they have aspirations to be the best world-wide.
They can't do that with a flaky application.

The company has several web services, but they need your help on improving one of the core services.

## This Application's Purpose:
* Get all messages for a user
* Search a user's messages for given text
* Create a new message for a user

## Call To Action:
This Message web service is a core application of the Message4You product.
They need your help to write cleaner code and resolve specific user issues. Do not break the existing api contract. All changes must be backwards compatible to not affect consumers.
The solution must also include automated tests (unit, integration, or both). Feel free to add any dependencies you need.

### Specific Issues:
* Current User Complaints:
    * Searches are slow and inconsistent
    * Timestamps are incorrect
    * Need an endpoint to edit a message's body
* Other observations:
    * IT Support has trouble debugging production problems
    * Unreliable network causes frequent failed requests to User Web Service
